  - YOU will see a button added in the side board
  - CLICK the button and select the .json file you saved in STEP1
  - Have a rest to see moggots blocked

```

```

[LIMITATION]: 
Cuz douban.com doesn't show all rating records
So these script cannot grab all moggots' id
For now it loops records both in hot/new pannels as more as it could be.
You better repeat it in a few hours, to block new added.

For default, all rating higher than 3 (>3) will be blocked
But it's configuable if you know how to do.
